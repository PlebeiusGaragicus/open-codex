# Open Codex CLI (Ollama Edition)

A Python-based refactor of the Open Codex CLI that uses Ollama for local LLM execution. This version focuses on self-hosted AI, running entirely on your local machine without requiring any external API keys.

## Project Goals

This refactor aims to:
1. Convert the existing Node.js-based CLI to Python
2. Replace OpenAI/cloud dependencies with Ollama for local execution
3. Maintain the same user experience and features while being fully self-hosted
4. Keep the same security model and permissions system
5. Optimize for local LLM performance and resource usage
